If you used GitHub to setup your repository and chose to initialize the project with a README, you can now clone your repository to your local machine.

If you're creating a repository on your local machine, you'll need to check out how to use the git init command.

In SourceTree, control+N or File -> New/Clone brings up the view seen in Clone Repo.png.

Add the url to your GitHub repo to the Source Path / URL field and choose the path to save to on your machine. Then give the repo bookmark a name.

Select Clone. Voila.
